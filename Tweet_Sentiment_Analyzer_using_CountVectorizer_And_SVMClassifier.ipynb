    "        One of the most basic ways we can numerically represent words is through the one-hot encoding method \n",
    "        also called count vectorizing.\n",
    "        The goal is to create a vector that has as many dimensions(column) as our vocabulary has unique words.\n",
    "        Each unique word has a unique dimension/column and will be represented by a 1 in that dimension with 0s\n",
    "        everywhere else.\n",
    "        As a result, really huge and sparse vectors are generated for each word in the vocabulary but these encodings\n",
    "        capture absolutely no relational information.\n",
    "        if we need that semantic relationship information we can use other encoding methods such as Word2Vec.\n",

    "        The CountVectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary\n",

    "    \n",
    "        ngrams range: default (1,1) : treat each word seperately\n",
    "                    : if we use (1,2) : treat each word as single (as min range = 1)\n",
    "                                        also comibine 2 (max range= 2) neighbouring words and treat them as one\n",
    "                                        usefull for names. example below\n",
    "        how to use:\n",
    "        Create an instance of the CountVectorizer class.\n",
    "        Call the fit() function in order to learn a vocabulary from one or more sentences.\n",
    "        call fit_transform()  to learn a vocabulary from one or more sentences and encode them at the same time.\n",
    "        Call the transform() function on one or more sentences as needed to encode each as a vector.\n",
    "        An encoded vector is returned with a length of the entire vocabulary and an integer count for the number of\n",
    "        times each word appeared in the Sentence.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Because these vectors will contain a lot of zeros, they are called sparse.\n",
    "        The vectors returned from a call to transform() will be sparse vectors, and we can transform them\n",
